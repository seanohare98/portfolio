    "role": "", //US Citizen born in Tokyo. Having grown up 1/2 in Michigan and 1/2 in Shanghai, China has strongly shaped the way I operate on professional and personal levels. Transferred to CUHK from Michigan State for non-academic reasons, but currently interviewing for 2020 internships in the US. Always trying to write cleaner and more optimized code. Although I spend most of my on-screen time in the office as a part-time SWE Intern, I can promise significant contributions to some exciting passions projects throughout this year! Also an avid track and field fan/competitor, with a long jump PR of 6.82m or 22ft5inches. I've competed in NCAA DI meets with MSU Track and Field and meets in Hong Kong with CUHK Track and Field.
