Transferred to Hong Kong for family/finances/sports, but currently interviewing for Summer 2020 internships in the US. Always trying to write cleaner, more efficient code. Although I do most of my coding at work as a part-time SWE Intern, I can promise significant contributions to my personal projects in 2020 (I acknowledge how hacked together they are)! I'm also an avid track and field fan/competitor, with a long jump PR of 6.82m/22ft5inches. I've competed in NCAA D1 meets with MSU Track and Field and also meets here in HK with CUHK Track and Field.",
